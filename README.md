## Hello !
I'm SomeBoringNerd, french dev that work with Java, JavaScript, C# and, at a begginer level, c++.<br>
A lot of my public repos are rewrites of proprietary tools for my personal use, or specific tools that do not have any practical equivalent.<br>
<br>
I make and publish games on my Itch.io page available 
<a href="https://someboringnerd.itch.io">at this link : https://someboringnerd.itch.io</a>
<br>
If you need a somewhat competent dev for quick projects, feel free to contact me on discord (SomeBoringNerd#5428), or by mail (contact@someboringnerd.xyz).<br>
Also, dont mind my activity on my public repo, a lot of my work is done on private repos (like websites for clients, my game, school projects, etc...)
<br>
note : archived projects are projects that will receive no support and if you ask me to help you with them, i'm likely going to ignore you.

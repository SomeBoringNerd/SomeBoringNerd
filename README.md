## Hello !
I'm SomeBoringNerd, french dev that work with Java, JavaScript, C# and, at a begginer level, c++.<br>
A lot of my public repos are rewrites of proprietary tools for my personal use, or specific tools that do not have any practical equivalent.<br>
<br>
I make and publish games on my Itch.io page available 
[![at this link : https://someboringnerd.itch.io]()](https://someboringnerd.itch.io)<br>
<br>
If you need a somewhat competent dev for quick projects, feel free to contact me on discord (SomeBoringNerd#5428), or by mail (someboringnerd@gmail.com).
